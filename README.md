## Supermarket Information Management App
### Description
This is an app designed to help supermarket staff record product information. With this app, supermarket employees can input the ID, type, price, and descriptions of products during the stocking process. If a product is seasonal, staff can temporarily remove it from the records. Additionally, if there are changes in the price or quality of a product, staff can promptly update it in the app. Furthermore, this app can assist staff in providing better customer service. For example, staff can quickly determine the price of a product by querying its ID, thereby improving efficiency in their work.
